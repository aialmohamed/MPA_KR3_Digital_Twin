## Introduction and Motivation

This repository documents my Master Project at the **THU** under the supervision of **Prof. List Ollinger**.

The project involves setting up a **digital twin** system for the **Kuka KR3 R540** robot. The key objectives are:

* Creating an interface between ROS and the robot
* Developing an OPC UA server to synchronize the real robot with the simulated robot
* Exploring potential use cases for the digital twin

### To-do

- [x] Create and setup a Git repository
- [ ] Create the filesystem of the Project
- [ ] Setup the the System requierments
- [ ] Create an approach for the requierments
- [ ] finilze a setup for the system (on my PC)
- [ ] finilize a setup for the Labortory (Pc of the Lab)
- [ ] (Optional) automate the build of the System
- [ ] Create software to interface the ROS2 with KR3 R540
- [ ] Test the Interface with KR3 R540 (on other KR3 robots)
- [ ] Create sofware for the ROS2 controlles (if needed)
- [ ] Define and document a usecase / application of the Digital Twin 
- [ ] Evaluate the benefits and challenges of using a Digital Twin in the identified scenarios.
- [ ] Exchange insights with industry experts, particularly Sven VÃ¶lker.
- [ ] Design and develop a software architecture that links the virtual and real robot.
- [ ] Implement communication between the virtual simulation and the real robot using OPC-UA.
- [ ] Test and validate the Digital Twin application through synchronized movements and data comparisons between simulation and reality.
