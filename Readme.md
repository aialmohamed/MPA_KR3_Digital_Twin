# Digital Twin KR3

## Introduction and Motivation

This repository documents my Master Project at the **THU** under the supervision of **Prof. Lisa Ollinger**.

The project involves setting up a **digital twin** system for the **Kuka KR3 R540** robot. The key objectives are:

* Creating an interface between ROS and the robot via OPC UA
* Exploring potential use cases for the digital twin
> [!NOTE]
> duration of the project: 6 months from the beginning of September (from 01.09.2024 to 28.02.2025)

>[!NOTE]
> This repository is manged with this [jira](

## To-do

### Setup and Repository
- [x] Create and set up a Git repository
- [x] Create the project's file system
- [x] Set up the system requirements
- [x] Create a concept for the props
- [x] Finalize the system setup (on my PC)
- [x] Set up the lab (lab's PC)
- [x] create connections by using UltraVCN and mount a driver to the Robot.
- [x] install the KUKAVARPROXY on the Lab PC and test it
- [x] (Optional) Automate the setup of the system

### Interface Development
- [x] Create the software for the interface between KR3 R540 and a local client (Experimental in c++)
- [x] Create the software for the interface between ROS2 and KR3 R540
- [ ] create an OPCUA Server
- [ ] create a start Dashboard (Web?)
- [ ] Test the interface with KR3 R540 (on other KR3 robots)
- [ ] Create the software for the ROS2 controllers (if required)

### Use Case and Evaluation
- [x] Define and document a use case / application of the digital twin
- [x] Evaluate the benefits and challenges of using a Digital Twin in the identified scenarios
- [x] Exchange insights with industry experts, particularly with Sven VÃ¶lker
