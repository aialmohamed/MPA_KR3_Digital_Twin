## Introduction and Motivation

This repository documents my Master Project at the **THU** under the supervision of **Prof. Lisa Ollinger**.

The project involves setting up a **digital twin** system for the **Kuka KR3 R540** robot. The key objectives are:

* Creating an interface between ROS and the robot
* Developing an OPC UA server to synchronize the real robot with the simulated robot
* Exploring potential use cases for the digital twin

## To-do

### Setup and Repository
- [x] Create a digital twin and set up a Git repository
- [ ] Create the project's file system
- [ ] Set up the system requirements
- [ ] Create a concept for the props
- [ ] Finalise the system setup (on my PC)
- [ ] Set up the lab (lab's PC)
- [ ] (Optional) Automate the setup of the system

### Interface Development
- [ ] Create the software for the interface between ROS2 and KR3 R540
- [ ] Test the interface with KR3 R540 (on other KR3 robots)
- [ ] Create the software for the ROS2 controllers (if required)

### Use Case and Evaluation
- [ ] Define and document a use case / application of the digital twin
- [ ] Evaluate the benefits and challenges of using a Digital Twin in the identified scenarios
- [ ] Exchange insights with industry experts, particularly with Sven VÃ¶lker

### Digital Twin Application
- [ ] Design and develop a software architecture that connects the virtual and real robots
- [ ] Implement the communication between the virtual simulation and the real robot using OPC-UA
- [ ] Test and validate the Digital Twin application through synchronised movements and data comparisons between simulation and reality
