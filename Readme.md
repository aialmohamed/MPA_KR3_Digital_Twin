# Digital Twin KR3

## Introduction and Motivation

> A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system designed to reflect a physical object accurately. It spans the object's lifecycle, is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help make decisions.

This repository documents my Master Project at the **THU** under the supervision of **Prof. Lisa Ollinger**.

The project involves setting up a **digital twin** system for the **Kuka KR3 R540** robot. The key objectives are:

* Creating an interface between ROS and the robot
* Developing an OPC UA server to synchronize the real robot with the simulated robot
* Exploring potential use cases for the digital twin

> duration of the project: 6 months from the beginning of September (from 01.09.2024 to 28.02.2025)

- [ ] Test and validate the Digital Twin application through synchronised movements and data comparisons between simulation and reality

## Approach 

### Conceptualisation

To create a working digital twin of a robot with ROS2 and Gazebo, we first need to understand the basic concept of ROS2.

ROS2 is a middleware that allows us to control and monitor different types of robots by separating the hardware management layer, the control management layer and the application layer and then dynamically connecting them.

This allows us to constantly change the controllers and easily switch off the hardware, making it easier to use the hardware.

For the digital twin to work on the KuKa KR3, we need to develop the following 
* a hardware interface 
* a ROS2 interface
* a ROS2 controller 

This is only the side of the real robot. For the simulation or digital twin, we need to develop the simulation environment (Gazebo), so we need a dedicated BringUp ROS2 workspace for that.

Fortunately, the team from last semester has already taken care of the simulation (and the controllers), so all we have to do now is develop the interfaces between the hardware and the ROS side.
