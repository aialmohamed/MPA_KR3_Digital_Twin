\section{Joint Trajectory Controller}

A controller for executing joint-space trajectories on a group of joints.
The controller interpolates in time between the points so that their distance 
can be arbitrary. Even trajectories with only one point are accepted. 
Trajectories are specified as a set of waypoints to be reached at specific 
time instants, which the controller attempts to execute as well as the 
mechanism allows. Waypoints consist of positions, and optionally velocities 
and accelerations.\cite{ros2_joint_trajectory_controller}
