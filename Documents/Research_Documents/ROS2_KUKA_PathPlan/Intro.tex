\section{Introduction}

The KUKA KR3 R540 robot, like many industrial robots,
is equipped with a native controller capable of executing 
predefined motion types, such as Point-to-Point (PTP), linear (LIN), 
and circular (CIRC). In typical setups, these motion types are manually 
programmed on the robot side using KUKA Robot Language (KRL). However, 
in modern robotics applications, there is an increasing demand to integrate 
robotic systems into external frameworks like ROS 2, where trajectory planning
and execution are handled externally.
