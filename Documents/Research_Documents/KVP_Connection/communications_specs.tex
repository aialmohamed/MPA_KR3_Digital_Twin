The time required to access a particular variable 
is non-deterministic, with experiments indicating 
that the average access time is approximately 5 
milliseconds. This time remains consistent 
regardless of the nature of the operation, 
whether it involves reading or writing, or the 
size of the data being handled. However, by 
employing data structures, it's possible to 
access multiple variables simultaneously, 
which can help reduce the overall access time.\cite{sanfilippo2015controlling}
