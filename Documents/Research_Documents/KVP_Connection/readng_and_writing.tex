\section{Reading and Writing}

\subsection{Messages}

In the KUKAVARPROXY protocol the main reading and writing is done to the global variables of the KUKA controller (in this case KRC4).
This means that we read or write to the global variables of the KUKA controller.
According to \cite{openkuka_system_variables} is a list of all the global variables that we are able to control, together with their descriptions.
In the appendix of this file are the tables of all the global variables with the data types and their description.
