\section{Introduction}

The main purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of the ROS2 Controller layer and how to implement the interfaces of this layer.
This is a critical part of this project because it enables us to connect the high level commands from the OPCUA Server with the controller ergo the 
hardware. The controller layer is responsible for the low level control of the robot. It is the layer that sends the commands to the hardware and receives the feedback from the hardware.
