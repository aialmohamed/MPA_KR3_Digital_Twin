\section{Industry 4.0 and DT}
In most industries, the development of Digital Twins is linked
to the concept of Industry 4.0, i.e. the implementation of Digital Twin concepts
, i.e. mirroring, shadowing and threading, is linked to or integrated with Industry 4.0 concepts
such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence (AI) and others.
Today, any new implementation of digital twins should include one or more Industry 4.0 concepts.\cite{pires2019digital} \\

\subsection{DT and CPS}
Cyber-physical systems integrate cyberworld and dynamic physical worlds in a multi-dimensional and complex manner. CPS provide real-time sensing, information feedback, dynamic control and other services through the integration and collaboration of computing, communication and control, known as the "3Cs".\cite{alam2017c2ps}
\\ Another concept associated with cyber-physical integration is the Digital Twin. A DT simulates real-world behaviour and provides feedback by creating high-fidelity virtual models of physical objects in virtual space.
A DT reflects a bidirectional dynamic mapping process, breaking product lifecycle boundaries and providing a complete digital footprint of products.\cite{alam2017c2ps}
This allows companies to predict physical problems earlier and with greater accuracy, to optimise the manufacturing process and to produce better products.\cite{alam2017c2ps}
