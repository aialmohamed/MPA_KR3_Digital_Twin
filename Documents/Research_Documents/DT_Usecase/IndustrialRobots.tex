\section{Industrial robots}

Industrial robots are automatically controlled, 
reprogrammable, general-purpose manipulating devices, 
programmable in three or more axes, 
which can be either fixed or mounted on a mobile 
platform for use in automation applications in an industrial 
environment.\cite{dagalakis1999industrial}\\
Robots can be used to weld, paint, assemble, 
disassemble,pick and place, pack and label, 
palletize.\cite{hagele2016industrial}
They can be an aid to material handling.\cite{hagele2016industrial}
